# Smart-Wearable-Insoles
Created a smart wearable insole system with FSR and IMU sensors to monitor foot pressure, step length, and center of pressure. Streamed real-time sensor data over Bluetooth Low Energy using ESP32 microcontorller for remote gait analysis. Implemented Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to classify gait for health and ergonomic assessments.
